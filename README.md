# üìÑ‚úè Diabetes  Deployment Detection Project
 **Diabetes Prediction:**  Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis.According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetesacross the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes mellitus orimply   diabetes   is   a   disease   caused   due   to   the   increase   level   of   blood   glucose.   Varioustraditional   methods,   based   on   physical   and   chemical   tests,   are   available   for   diagnosingdiabetes.   However,   early   prediction   of   diabetes   is   quite   challenging   task   for   medicalpractitioners due to complex interdependence on various factors as diabetes affects humanorgans such as kidney, eye, heart, nerves, foot etc. Data science methods have the potential tobenefit other scientific fields by shedding new light on common questions. One such task isto help make predictions on medical data. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field indata science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of thisproject is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patientwith a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques.This project aims to predict diabetes via three different supervised machine learning methodsincluding: SVM, Logistic regression, KNN. This project also aims to propose an effectivetechnique for earlier detection of the diabetes disease using Machine learning algorithms andend to end deployment using flask.
